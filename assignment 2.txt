Q1. #0  syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:133
    #1  0x0000000080001a90 in usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:68
    #2  0x0000003ffffff09c in ?? ()
  
Q2. The value of register a7 is 15 and it represents the syscall number 15 (SYS_OPEN).
    00000000000003c6 <open>:
    .global open
    open:
    li a7, SYS_open
    3c6:	48bd                	li	a7,15

Q3. The sstatus value is 0x200000022. This leads to last 3 hex bits (022) being 0 0010 0010. 
The 8th bit (0) tells us that previous mode was user mode.

Q4.  Qemu output:
    xv6 kernel is booting

    hart 1 starting
    hart 2 starting
    scause=0xd sepc=0x80001cda stval=0x0
    panic: kerneltrap
Register used:A3

Q5. The kernel attempts to access address 0 which isn't mapped in the kernel address space. This in turn causes a page
fault (as shown by scause = 0xd, aka load page fault). The kernel panics as it can not handle this illegal mem address.

Q6. The process was init with the pid as 1.
